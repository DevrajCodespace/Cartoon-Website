            <p style="color: white;">Escanor, also known as the Lion's Sin of Pride, is a member of the Seven Deadly 
                Sins. Escanor is known for his unique power called Sunshine, which makes him incredibly powerful during 
                the day but leaves him weak and frail at night. His Sacred Treasure is the Divine Axe, Rhitta1. Despite 
                his immense strength, Escanor is known for his love of poetry and his tendency to boast about his own 
                greatness. He is also deeply in love with Merlin and is one of the most powerful members of the Seven 
                Deadly Sins.</p>
